Ev'ry time you come around
I hear that lonesome sound
Ooh, train of memories

Boxcars go flyin' by
With all my dreams inside
Ooh, train of memories

I see you wavin'
Hear you say goodbye
Rollin' down the tracks
Of the tears you made me cry
Ooh, train of memories

This locomotion runs on pain
So it's a never ending thing
Ooh, train of memories

Rumblin' through my mind
Pullin' the past behind
Ooh, train of memories

I see you wavin'
Hear you say goodbye
Rollin' down the tracks
Of the tears you made me cry
Ooh, train of memories

Ooh, here it comes again
Ooh, it's more than I can stand
No matter what I do
It brings me back to you

Ooh, train of memories
Ooh, train of memories
This train memories
