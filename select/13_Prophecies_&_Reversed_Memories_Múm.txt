You've dreamt this all before
You've sang this song before
You've seen it all before
It was just a little different that's all

You've dreamt this all before
You've sang this song before
You've seen it all before
It was in another world that's all

Long, long, long, long ago
Long, long, long, long ago

You've dreamt this all before
You've sang this song before
You've seen it all before
It was in another world that's all

You've dreamt this all before
You've dreamt this all before
You've dreamt this all before
It was in another bed that's all

Long, long, long, long ago
Long, long, long, long ago

(Prophecies are memories in prophecies and memories)

You've dreamt this all before
You've dreamt this all before
You've dreamt this all before
It was in another bed that's all

(Prophecies are memories in prophecies and memories)

You've dreamt this all before
You've dreamt this all before
You've dreamt this all before
It was in another world that's all

Long, long, long, long ago
Long, long, long, long ago
